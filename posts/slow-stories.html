<p>Some stories don’t want to be rushed.</p>
<p>They unfold in pauses, in atmosphere, in what’s left unsaid. They ask the reader not for speed, but for attention.</p>
<p>Writing slowly isn’t indulgence — it’s fidelity to the kind of story being told.</p>
<br><br>
<p>That's where I like to live — in the slow burn of stories that trust their reader.</p>
<p>You won't see the whole picture by the end of book one.  You won't get the tale by the end of book two.  You might start seeing hints of the larger picture by the end of book three.</p>
<br><br>
<p>I enjoy writing series because they give the world room to breathe.  You see hints of magic working in the background and patches of deeper lore hidden in the folds of the story's reality.  Like an intricate patchwork quilt.  I stitch them together with love and care.</p>
<br><br>
<p>All the hints are there for the careful reader to discover.  They're there — hidden in the margins where one doesn't think to look.  What I didn't say matters as much as what I do say.  Sometimes my characters assume wrongly.  Sometimes they won't dare think of the point because even thinking about it feels like bad luck.  But it's still there for the discerning reader to see.  Always.</p>
<br><br>
<p>This is how we play our game.</p>
<p>I give you the broad strokes.</p>
<p>You fill in the details.</p>
<br><br>
<p>And together, we build a beautiful world slowly.</p>
<p>Piece by piece.</p>
<p>Page by page.</p>
