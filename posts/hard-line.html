<p>Everyone has something they won’t compromise on. We each draw a line in the sand that isn’t meant to be crossed — though where that line falls differs from person to person.</p>
<br>
<p>For me, that line is the distinction between art and pornography.</p>
<br>
<p>In recent years, it’s become increasingly popular to add sex to books for the sake of marketability. Stories are often grouped by their level of “spice” into categories like Young Adult (YA), New Adult (NA), or Adult (A).</p>
<br>
<p>I don’t write that way.</p>
<br>
<p>I approach my manuscripts from a story-first perspective, which means they don’t neatly fit into one category or another. The “spice,” if it appears at all, often comes later in the story. The first book in a series might read as YA — but the worlds I build also explore darker themes that I believe are worth talking about. Violence. Assault. Regret. Redemption. Those elements push my work closer to NA.</p>
<br>
<p>And when it comes to spice, my rule is simple:</p>
<p>I only show the scenes that best serve the relationship between the characters involved.</p>
<br><br>
<p>That means yes — there may be some spice.</p>
<p>No — it may not be the most explicit or exhilarating you’ll find.</p>
<p>And no — I won’t add scenes just to sell more books.</p>
<br><br>
<p>I reserve the right to fade to black.</p>
<p>I reserve the right to choose restraint.</p>
<p>I reserve the right to be an artist.</p>
<br><br>
<p>And if that makes me “less marketable,” then so be it.</p>
