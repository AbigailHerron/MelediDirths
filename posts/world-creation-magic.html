<p>A world is more than an idea.</p>
<p>It’s culture, philosophy, science, magic—</p>
<p>and how all of that plays into daily life.</p>
<br><br>
<p>Creating worlds takes time, and each author does it differently. For me, there are no notes, no painfully detailed plans, no maps to follow. It’s all imagination, the feel of the moment, from one draft to the next.</p>
<br><br>
<p>In the first draft, I try to depict the scenes in my mind’s eye: what I see, hear, and feel, poured into words. It’s a complete mess—terrible writing, bad ideas, hidden gems, and most importantly of all: heart.</p>
<br><br>
<p>From these scenes, questions start to form:</p>
<p>Why would my characters do this?</p>
<p>Is it cultural? Colloquial? Historical?</p>
<p>Then bigger questions follow:</p>
<p>What inspired these habits?</p>
<p>What drives the danger?</p>
<p>How acceptable is this behavior?</p>
<br><br>
<p>Hundreds of small questions, each adding a layer to the world I’m building.</p>
<br><br>
<p>All of this becomes a story in and of itself—a layered history of context that slowly bleeds into my stories. Some of it I’ll share. Most of it I’ll hide.</p>
<br><br>
<p>That’s how I solidify my worlds.</p>
<p>I ponder history.</p>
<p>I examine geography.</p>
<p>I taste the magic—or its absence.</p>
<p>I wrestle with the science.</p>
<br><br>
<p>Then I bake in habits—how people speak, what they take for granted, what’s public knowledge and what’s esoteric.</p>
<p>Mannerisms shift, shaped by what’s known and what’s lost to time.</p>
<br><br>
<p>By draft two, I start refining.</p>
<p>I fix plot holes, yes, but I also weave the world’s budding rules into my characters’ actions.</p>
<p>Little by little, the story and its world align.</p>
<br><br>
<p>By draft three, the world is set in stone, and my characters must adjust—or be scorned by it.</p>
<br><br>
<p>From a thought to a question.</p>
<p>From a question to a legacy.</p>
<br><br>
<p>The reasons are hidden, but they are there.</p>
<p>In the way someone carries themselves.</p>
<p>In the myths and legends.</p>
<p>In the things they take for granted.</p>
<br><br>
<p>That is how my worlds are formed.</p>
